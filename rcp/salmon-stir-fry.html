        <p>This was a dish I originally created for my girlfriend's birthday lunch - she likes salmon, and she likes stir-fry, so it was a no-brainer. I made some slight changes this time around, and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to how good it was the first time, but that's probably nostalgia and sleep deprivation speaking...</p>

        <p>The wok-hei from the stir-fry technique makes the veg and noodles really stand out, and brings out the best in the fermented sauces typical in East-Asian cooking. The grilled salmon is the stand-out centrepiece of this dish, though, with the smoked paprika adding a subtle twang amidst the decadent sweet and umami flavours of the glaze.</p>
