        <p>This was a dish I originally created for my girlfriend's birthday lunch - she likes salmon, and she likes stir-fry, so it was a no-brainer. I made some slight changes this time around, and unfortunately it didn't quite live up to how good it was the first time, but that's probably nostalgia and sleep deprivation speaking...</p>

        <p>The wok-hei from the stir-fry technique makes the veg and noodles really stand out, and brings out the best in the fermented sauces typical in East-Asian cooking. The grilled salmon is the stand-out centrepiece of this dish, though, with the smoked paprika adding a subtle twang amidst the decadent sweet and umami flavours of the glaze.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>Serves four</p>

        <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets</li>
            <li>Light soy sauce</li>
            <li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Smoked paprika</li>
            <li>4 Nests of egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 Medium onion</li>
            <li>2 Cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 Thai red chillis</li>
            <li>1 Leek</li>
            <li>2 Carrots</li>
            <li>Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>Dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rub around a teaspoon each of light soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, honey, and smoked paprika into each of the salmon fillets, then leave in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to marinate. <em>With salmon, it is important not to marinate for too long, as this can denature the fish and make the texture mushy. That being said, the first time I made this recipe, I marinated the salmon for around four hours with no negative effects, so your mileage may vary.</em></li>
            <li>Preheat the grill on a medium heat around 10 minutes before marination is due to be done.</li>
            <li>About 5 minutes before marination is due to finish, start preparing the noodles. Place all four nests in a wok and cover with boiling water, turning the heat to medium. Cook for rougly 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are boiling, start preparing the aromatics: slice the onion, grate the garlic and ginger, and finely mince the two chillis.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are finished, drain into a collinder or sieve and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.</li>
            <li>At this point, transfer the salmon to a baking tray/grill and pour on half of any remaining marinade. Save the rest for later.</li>
            <li>Finish any further preparation of aromatics and heat the wok over a low heat to dry it. Once dry, turn the heat up to high and add in a splash of oil, swirling it around the pan to create a non-stick coating. Add the aromatics and turn the heat down to medium.</li>
            <li>Peel and slice the carrot into thin rectangles, adding to the wok. Half the leek and wash thouroughly under running water - dirt has a tendancy to collect in a diagonal line where the green meets the white. Slice and add to the wok.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables have softened slightly, add the noodles and toss to avoid sticking.</li>
            <li>Add in the leftover marinade, two tablespoons of oyster sauce, a tablespoon each of light and dark soy sauce, a tablespoon of honey, and a small squirt of fish sauce. Toss everything together and turn the heat up to light any aerosolised oil particles on fire, creating a smokey flavour known as "wok-hei". <em><strong>N.B</strong> - this only works on gas stoves.</em></li>
            <li>Plate up your portions of stir-fry and remove the salmon from the grill, laying one fillet on top of each plate.The salmon should have a nice char on the top by this point, and should flake easily under a fork.</li>
            <li>Grab some chopsticks (or a fork, you heathen) and dig in.</li>
        </ol>
