        <p>This scrumptious cottage pie recipe was pretty much made up as I went along, and ended up being a tad rushed due to trains.</p>

        <p>I vastly underestimated how much mashed potato we'd need, hence the meagre display atop the meat in the above picture. 
            Due to the afforementioned train I had to catch, I also had to take it out earlier than I would have liked, leading to a distinct
            lack of crisp on the top. My girlfriend rectified this after I left, as she forgot that we had put it back in the oven after taking our
            portions for tea. She only remembered half an hour later, at which point the previously anaemic mashed potato was practically cremated, or so I'm told.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, the dish was indeed tasy, if not lacking in grated cheese which we unfortunately didn't have in stock at the time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>~1kg Potatoes</li>
            <li>A knob of butter</li>
            <li>1 Medium Onion</li>
            <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>1 Leek</li>
            <li>3 Carrots</li>
            <li>A handful of garden peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
            <li>Beef and/or chicken stock cubes (bovril would also work)</li>
            <li>Worcester Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt/pepper (freshly ground is the best)</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Cheese, to grate (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em><strong>N.B.</strong> - The leek, carrots, and peas can be substituted for any vegtables you have that need using up; this is a very adaptable dish and the meat can be padded out with pretty much anything!</em></p>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to its maximum setting. A grill works as an alternative if necessary.</li>
            <li>Peel and dice rougly 1kg of potatoes. Put in a pan with cold water and a pinch of salt, put the lid on, and then bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are heating up, prepare the aromatic vegetables: slice the onion and finely mince the garlic. I like to grate my garlic cloves with the skin on as this is quicker and easier than using a dull* uni student's knife!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>*I should clarify, it is the knife that is dull, and not the uni student...</em></p>
