        <p>This was a very basic porridge recipe I blagged to make us a scrumptious breakfast. That being said, I had just consumed half a tub of Ben & Jerry's...</p>

        <p>I have long been a honey fan, and peanut butter seems to add a delicious cloying consistency to porridge that I can never get enough of. Notes of cinnamon and nutmeg also shine through to add some complexity and wintery warmth.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>Serves two</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 mug full of oats</li>
            <li>~300ml Milk - <em>full-fat milk works best, but any will do, including plant-based alternatives. I imagine soya milk would work best here, but I have used oat milk in the past with success.</em></li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice - <em>I chose honey and peanut butter here, but you could go healthy and top with fresh fruit.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Put the oats in a saucepan with rougly half of the milk and turn to a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add in a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon to your preference. I used about a teaspoon of each.</li>
            <li>As the oats start to soak up some of the milk, add in a little more.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until the oats are soft and cooked through, then add milk or cook further until the consistency is as desired, or you run out of milk... <em>I prefer my porridge a little thicker, as that is how my dad used to make it. My mum, who is a trained chef, always made hers thinner with more milk, which I wasn't a fan of, but that seems to be the fancier style of porridge. Experiment and see what you like.</em></li>
            <li>Transfer to bowls and top with your chosen toppings. Take the consistency of the toppings into consideration: sugar-based syrups will make the porridge thinner as the sugar dissolves, and nut butters will make it thicker.</li>
        </ol>
