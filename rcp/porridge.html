        <p>This was a very basic porridge recipe I blagged to make us a scrumptious breakfast. That being said, I had just consumed half a tub of Ben & Jerry's...</p>

        <p>I have long been a honey fan, and peanut butter seems to add a delicious cloying consistency to porridge that I can never get enough of. Notes of cinnamon and nutmeg also shine through to add some complexity and wintery warmth.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 mug full of oats</li>
            <li>~300ml Milk - <em>full-fat milk works best, but any will do, including plant-based alternatives. I imagine soya milk would work best here.</em></li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice - <em>I chose honey and peanut butter here, but you could go healthy and top with fresh fruit.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
